A Respository containing important source code created in UE5 by me

About SlateRadialProgressBar: A Radial Progress Bar which is basically based upon an SImage, it also has properties synchronized at the moment for my personal use cases but you can always edit that if you'd like.
Most of the main code is basically just in Slate (I didn't use standard Slate & UMG because this was something I thought was better achievable in Slate). If you are new to Slate and UMG, when you import the C++ Classes
into your project you will only see the RadialProgressBar.h and .cpp files, the slate one will not be visible because those are the "UMG" files and are just a wrapper around the Slate .h and .cpp files.
Additionally I have also made another SLATE ARGUMENT (LayerImageAsset Class) which you can use to add layers of the image.
